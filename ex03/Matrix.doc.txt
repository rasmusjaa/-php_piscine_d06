<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
An instance can be contructed with an array that must have value:
- 'preset' (with value of class constant IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, RZ,
TRANSLATION or PROJECTION, e.g.: new Matrix( array( 'preset' => Matrix::IDENTITY ) ); )

Other values required based on preset:
’scale’: the scale factor, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth SCALE.
’angle’: the rotation angle in radians, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth RX, RY or RZ.
’vtc’: translation vector, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth TRANSLATION.
’fov’: projection field of view in degrees mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’ratio’: projected image ratio, mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’near’: projection’s near clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.
’far’: projection’s far clipping plane mandatory when ’preset’ is worth PROJECTION.

You can enable verbose mode with Matrix::$verbose.

Methods from the Matrix Class never modify the current instance. Once a
matrix is instantiated, its status is final.

Following public methods are provided:

Matrix mult( Matrix $rhs );
returns the multiplication of both matrices.

Vertex transformVertex( Vertex $vtx );
returns a new vertex resulting from
the transformation of the vertex by the matrix.
